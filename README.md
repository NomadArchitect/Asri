## Custom Attribute

### Asri full-width display (`afwd`)

![full-width-display preview](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mustakshif/Asri-for-SiYuan@main/assets/custom-attributes-preview_v7.gif)

This attribute allows blocks to be displayed in full page width, which can be used to emphasize specific content or beautify the layout. The full-width display style applies to images, databases, iframes, and horizontal-layout superblocks.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `afwd`„ÄÄ„ÄÄ | - `all` (Makes all blocks that support this attribute in the document display in full width)<br />- `p` (Makes all images in the document display in full width)<br />- `db` (Makes all database blocks in the document display in full width)<br />- `iframe` (Makes all iframe blocks in the document display in full width, including videos, widgets, and embedded web pages)<br />- `sb` (Makes all **horizontal-layout** superblocks in the document display in full width) | Applies to document blocks.<br />All attribute values except `all` can be used simultaneously, and should be separated by **spaces** |
| `afwd` | - `on` (Enable full-width display of the block individually)<br />- `off` (Disable full-width display of the block individually) | Applies to paragraph blocks, database blocks, iframe blocks, superblocks.|

#### Usage Examples

Applied to document blocks:

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `afwd` | `all`         |
| `afwd` | `p sb iframe` |
| `afwd` | `db`          |
| `afwd` | ...   |

Applied to supported content blocks:

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `afwd` | `on`   |
| `afwd` | `off`  |

In addition to adding custom attributes by <kbd>shift + click block icon</kbd> - <kbd>Custom</kbd>, you can also use the `Attribute Quick Add` plugin to quickly add this attribute to supported blocks. Here is a configuration example of the plugin:

```json
{
    "@type/d": {
        "Full-width display for all supported blocks": {
            "afwd": "all"
        },
        "Full-width display for all database blocks and images": {
            "afwd": "db p"
        }
    },
    "Enable full-width display individually": {
        "afwd": "on"
    },
    "Disable full-width display individually": {
        "afwd": "off"
    }
}
```

The above configuration adds two options for document blocks and content blocks in the plugin menu, respectively, for quickly enabling and disabling the full-width display attribute for related content.

To restore the default state of the block, manually delete this custom attribute in the block attribute.

#### <em>Precautions</em>

* Full-width display only applies to the **first-level** blocks in the document. If a block is nested in other content blocks, applying this attribute to it will not produce any effect. For example, applying this attribute to an image paragraph block in a quote block will not change the style of the paragraph block unless the external quote block is cancelled.
* Full-width display is only effective in the editing area of the main window and small windows, and does not work in block reference preview windows, export previews, backlink panel, search result previews, etc.
* Enabling full-width display may cause the page to feel more jumpy when the editing area's size changes and automatically returns to the cursor position.
* The previous version's attribute name `asri-full-width-display` will be deprecated in future updates.
