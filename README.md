## Attention

Asri has not been fully adapted for mobile and tablet devices. Please use it cautiously on these platforms.

## Theme Features

* ⚖️ Introducing top-bar fusion, striking a balance between aesthetics and efficiency.

* ➖ Dividing lines simplified, creating a consistent and organized layout style.
